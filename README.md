# JavaSerialization
Author: Oluwaseyi Akinbobola
This mini-project contains code that exemplifies how to serialize and de-serialize an object in Java.
Note!!!
String containing file location in the SerializeDemo and DeserializeDemo files should be replaced by file path to a valid text file on your device to prevent unexpected behaviour (Although, exceptions have been added to prevent abnormal behaviour)
